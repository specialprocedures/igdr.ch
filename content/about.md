I am an experienced researcher, engineer and coordinator specialising in data and code for non-profits and think tanks. As a skilled and creative technologist, and love to use complex, novel datasets to deliver outstanding, impactful research.

If you're interested in working with me or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out by email (ian@igdr.ch), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igdrch/), or on [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/Om0PCx4kCcCtoRA6AzSTYFC5XiWVmFeEkf-1X5l3ON2GpHb2jj9Bs5vhUD7Ca_-o).

You can find me on Github as [specialprocedures](https://github.com/specialprocedures/).

## My Story

In 2008 I traveled to Georgia to work on displacement issues with [CHCA](https://chca.org.ge/eng/). A few months later, the 2008 war broke out and I unexpectedly found myself involved in a humanitarian response.

This experience turned into a humanitarian career. I spent the next ten years working in MEAL, funding and compliance for international aid organisations, predominantly in the South Caucasus and Middle East. For much of this time, I worked in [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/) country programmes, before joining the movement to mainstream cash programming in humanitarian response with the [Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igdrch/).

In 2017, I went back to school at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/). I took a quantitative route through a Masters in Public Policy, learning Python, statistics, and methods such as NLP, GIS and network analysis. From there, I took up a policy analysis role at the [Caucasus Research Resource Center](https://crrc.ge/en/) in Georgia, before moving on to data science and engineering for the [Global Strategic Communications Council](https://gsccnetwork.org/).

## igdr.ch

This consultancy is almost two decades old. I've always filled down-time between full-time contracts with short-term consultancies. Over the years this has evolved from copy-editing, to bid-writing, gap-fill in funding and project management roles, to research and evaluation.

Today I am primarily available for research and engineering contracts, but I'm also here to provide support on monitoring and evaluation, fundraising and communications.

## Outside of work

I currently live in Tbilisi, Georgia, with my partner and dog. I do a lot of reading, dog-walks and an occasional [bit of art](https://pixelfed.social/specialprocedures).
