I am an experienced researcher, analyst and coordinator specialising in data and code for non-profits and think tanks. As a skilled and creative technologist, and love to use complex, novel datasets to deliver outstanding, impactful research.

I use Python and Linux, and work on NLP/LLM, network analysis, and OSINT projects. Research interests include:

- media, PR and lobbying
- natural language research methods
- geopolitics, economics, and illicit finance

I was an aid worker in a past life and write a mean proposal.
