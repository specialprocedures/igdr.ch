I am an experienced researcher, engineer and coordinator specialising in data and code for non-profits and think tanks. As a skilled and creative technologist, and love to use complex, novel datasets to deliver outstanding, impactful research.

If youâ€™re interested in working with me or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out by email (ian@igdr.ch), or on LinkedIn.

## My Story

In 2008 I traveled to Georgia to work on displacement issues with [CHCA](https://chca.org.ge/eng/). A few months later, the 2008 war broke out and I unexpectedly found myself involved in a humanitarian response.

This experience turned into a humanitarian career. I spent the next ten years working in M&E, funding and compliance for international aid organisations, predominantly in the South Caucasus and Middle East. For much of this time, I worked in [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/) country programmes, before joining the movement to mainstream cash programming in humanitarian response with the Cash Learning Partnership.

In 2017, I went back to school at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/). I took a quantitative route through a Masters in Public Policy, learning Python, statistics, and methods such as NLP, GIS and network analysis. From there, I took up a role at [CRRC](https://crrc.ge/en/), Georgia's foremost think tank, before going international again: working on natural language processing and data engineering for the [Global Strategic Communications Council](https://gsccnetwork.org/).

## igdr.ch

This consultancy is almost two decades old. I've always filled down-time between full-time contracts with short-term consultancies. Over the years this has evolved from copy-editing, to bid-writing, gap-fill in funding and project management roles, to research and evaluation.

Today I am primarily available for research and engineering contracts, but I'm also here to provide support on monitoring and evaluation, fundraising and communications.

## Outside of work

I currently live in Tbilisi, Georgia, with my partner and dog. I do a lot of reading, dog-walks and an occasional [bit of art](https://pixelfed.social/specialprocedures).
