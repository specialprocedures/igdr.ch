# From the archives

In 2017 I was contracted to write case studies on Oxfam's flagship programmes in Sierra Leone, Ghana, Tajikistan, Rwanda, Kenya, Pakistan and the South Caucasus.

Over several months, I worked with technical leads to capture the context, implementation, achievements and challenges of their world-leading programming.

The research entailed desk-review of programme documents and key informant interviews with programme staff and stakeholders.

You can read them all below or on Oxfam's [Policy and Practice](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/authors/goodrich-ian/) site.
