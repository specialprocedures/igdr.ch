# Tech

[Has the bailout of generative AI already begun?](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/has-the-bailout-of-generative-ai)

> “The way this works”, said an investor friend to me this morning: “is that when Nvidia is about to miss their quarter, Jen Hsun calls David Sacks, who then gets this government initiative to place a giant order for chips that go into a warehouse.”

> I obviously can’t confirm or deny that actually happened. My friend might or might not have been kidding. But either way the White House’s new Science and AI program, Genesis, announced by Executive Order on Monday, does seem to involve the government buying a lot of chips from a lot of AI companies, many of which are losing money.

[OpenAI needs to raise at least $207bn by 2030 so it can continue to lose money, HSBC estimates](archive.md/www.ft.com/content/23e54a28-6f63-4533-ab96-3756d9c88bad), Bryce Elder, NYT

> OpenAI is a money pit with a website on top. That much we know already, but since OpenAI is a private company, there’s a lot of guesswork required when estimating the depth of the pit.

[UK Digital Services Tax raises £800M from global tech giants](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/28/uk_digital_services_tax/), Lindsay Clark, El Reg

> Treasury haul beats early forecasts, yet captures only a fraction of the revenue generated in Britain

> A quick sweep of UK revenue from online giants shows the scale of the challenge. Amazon, for example, generates around £29 billion (2024) in UK sales. Google's total UK revenue from search alone is estimated at around £15 billion, gained from its 90 percent share in the search market. Facebook's UK revenue is estimated at around £3.1 billion.

> Liu said the lab is committed to an open-source approach and publishes its training data sets, source code, and model weights. A group of AI companies, including many in China, have adopted similar open-model strategies to expand their user base and narrow the gap with industry leaders. Open models developed by Chinese companies like Alibaba’s Qwen and Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2 are now used by some Silicon Valley firms as cheaper alternatives to OpenAI and Anthropic’s proprietary systems.

[DIY NAS: 2026 Edition](https://blog.briancmoses.com/2025/11/diy-nas-2026-edition.html), Brian Moses

> An 8-bay DIY NAS with 10GbE networking, TrueNAS 25.10.0.1, an Intel N355 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a smallish form factor that occupies less than 20 liters of your office space.

>Positron is a next-generation IDE for data science, built by Posit PBC. It’s built on Code OSS, the open-source core of Visual Studio Code, which means that many of the features and keyboard shortcuts you’re familiar with are already in place.

# Policy and politics

[Removal of judge in Palestine Action ban legal challenge ‘deeply concerning’](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/25/removal-judge-palestine-action-ban-legal-challenge-justice-chamberlain), Haroon Siddique, the Guardian

> Concerns have been raised after the judge who was expected to hear a legal challenge to the ban on Palestine Action was removed from the case at the last minute without explanation.

[The Politics of Housing](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/progressive-politics-research-network/research-briefs/), Tarik Abou-Chadi, Björn Bremer, Silja Häusermann, Nuffield Politics Research Centre
> Despite housing affordability being among the most pressing issues for households, however,the salience of housing remains relatively low on political parties’ agendas. Compared to many other issues, even progressive political parties often seem to shy away from putting housing prices and rents center-stage in their campaigns and communication. This relatively low salience of housing as a topic of social policy and distributive politics is also a result of the fact that housing has politically been seen through the lens of "real estate", i.e. as an asset instead of a social need for most of the past decades.

> When politicians talk about housing as a distributive social issue, two main lines of argumentation tend to stand out: the first is “build, build, build", i.e. an emphasis on deregulating housing markets to allow for more and faster construction. The other emerges from the radical right. It has increasingly integrated questions of housing into its political agenda and frames housing primarily as an issue of immigration and scarcity.

[Fossil fuel lobbyists outnumber all Cop30 delegations except Brazil, report says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/14/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-cop30), Nina Lakhani, the Guardian

> More than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists have been granted access to the Cop30 climate negotiations in Belém, significantly outnumbering every single country’s delegation apart from the host Brazil

[The granular origins of inflation](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/granular-origins-inflation), Santiago Alvarez-Blaser, Raphael Auer, Sarah Lein, Andrei Levchenko, VoxEU

> Textbook monetary economics views inflation as fundamentally driven by aggregate shocks, such as money supply or policy rates. This column presents empirical evidence that inflation is highly granular – it is significantly influenced by the prices set by a small number of large firms.

# Culture

[The truth about hitmen: Britain's gangland killers are incompetent](https://unherd.com/2025/11/the-truth-about-hitmen/), Max Daly, Unherd
> The intercepted phone chats, beginning with the text exchange detailed above, show how the job was offered around the London criminal underworld like a gig on the chore-outsourcing app, TaskRabbit — with one of the three killings ultimately taken on by a low-level drug user who was seemingly incapable of finding his target, let alone killing him.

[The Lonely New Vices of American Life](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/11/american-vice-national-character/684785/), Dan Brooks, the Atlantic

> The decline in drinking coincides with a decline in social activity more broadly. A variety of causes have been blamed for this trend toward isolation, phones chief among them. Maybe the phone theory is correct, and maybe it is not; the forces behind broad national trends are endlessly debatable. At the micro level, however, the influences of different vices become more clear. Consider a night out with friends, and the diverging consequences of buying a round of shots versus opening up Instagram.

> The systemic effects of millions more people looking at their phones and millions fewer getting drunk remain to be seen. These are not the only changing national vices, however; more Americans are also gambling online, consuming marijuana, and watching pornography than ever before. And these new, ascendant vices are likely to shape American life in the 21st century as much as mass day drinking shaped life in the 19th.

[Why Is Everyone Talking About Getting ‘Oneshotted’?](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/02/oneshotted-going-online/681774/), Dan Brooks, the Atlantic

> Let us agree, for the purposes of this argument, that social media totally rots. It contains some good stuff, but overall, it is like a cookie the size of a football field with three chocolate chips in it, plus an equivalent number of staples. We keep opening our phones and sifting through the dross, though, because we want to find that single, elusive thing that will blow our mind. These things are, for the most part, not available online. 

> Maybe you will get oneshotted by a romantic relationship, or your first surfing lesson, or the touring production of Hamilton; whatever it is, you will probably not be holding your phone when it happens. In fact, the less one uses the internet—due to incarceration or hiking or whatever—the more one realizes that being online actually prevents a variety of oneshot-type experiences. But screen addicts (myself included) keep going back, hoping to get oneshotted by an internet that, characterized by ephemerality and continuous renewal though it may be, is also marked by a crushing sameness.

[How to fix a typewriter and your life](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/20/us/typewriter-repair-seattle-bremerton.html), Kurt Streeter, Ruth Fremson, NYT

> “It’s like Zen,” Lundy says about those hours at the bench. “There are times when it is just very relaxing to be standing in front of the machine and slowly cleaning it, tweaking the adjustment so visually things start to really line up.”
