# Hardware
- `big-brother`: A [2021 Lenovo Legion S7](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lenovo-legion-s7-shadow-black) as a barely-portable workstation, number cruncher and gaming rig.
- `little-sister`: A Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 for when I'm out and about. Running Arch, btw.

# Operating Systems
Daily-driving Linux as a desktop OS for the last four years. Having been off and on with Linux since my teenage years, I gave up on Windows completely when they started putting ads in the start bar. 

I'm not gonna lie, being able to game via [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) made it all possible, Steam are doing God's work.

I love Arch, and I'm currently running [EndeavorOS](https://endeavouros.com/) on `big-brother` and [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) on `little-sister`. I started off with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), but the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) and [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) won me over.

I've played around with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [hyprland](https://hypr.land/) for my desktop environment and learned a tonne along the way. My key piece of learning is that life's too short to spend mucking around with dotfiles, and I'm happily back on [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) where I don't need to think about what sort of application launcher defines me as a person.

# Software
- I spend an inordinate amount of time in VSCode, and use Copilot as a coding assistant
- kitty + zsh + oh-my-zsh + powerlevel10k in the terminal

# Python

# Other languages
I've got professional experience with R, exclusively survey work; academic experience with Stata. I did one project in D3 a while back and I'm keen to play with it more.

# Cloud
Having spent a lot of time shaking my fist at the sky and moaning about how much better everything would be if we just use Debian boxes like the good old days, a few recent projects have gotten me functional with [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/).
